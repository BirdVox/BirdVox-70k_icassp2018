Step 1 :

If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 8910:localhost:8910 vl1019@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host, 
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh vl1019@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 8910:localhost:8910 vl1019@prince

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with
