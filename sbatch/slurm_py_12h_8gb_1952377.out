Jupyter server is running on: c17-01
Job starts at: Fri Aug 25 08:57:06 EDT 2017

Step 1 :

If you are working in NYU campus, please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 7385:localhost:7385 vl1019@prince.hpc.nyu.edu

If you are working off campus, you should already have ssh tunneling setup through HPC bastion host,
that you can directly login to prince with command

ssh vl1019@prince

Please open an iTerm window, run command

ssh -L 7385:localhost:7385 vl1019@prince

Step 2:

Keep the iTerm windows in the previouse step open. Now open browser, find the line with

The Jupyter Notebook is running at:

the URL is something: http://localhost:/?token=XXXXXXXX

you should be able to connect to jupyter notebook running remotly on prince compute node with above url
