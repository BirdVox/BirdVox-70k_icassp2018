* Results of the ICASSP 2018 paper by Lostanlen et al. are reproducible by running Python scripts `001` to `025` in this order, from the `src` folder. Arguments to these scripts are provided in the command line. The folders `sbatch/ID/sbatch` contains files for scheduling jobs with a Slurm workload manager, like the one that is maintained in the high-performance computing facility at NYU. These scripts can be generated programmatically by running Python scripts `sbatch/generate_ID.py`. The log files produced by the job manager are written to `sbatch/slurm`. We make them available to the general public, as they contain information on running times and memory footprints for each stage of the benchmark.
